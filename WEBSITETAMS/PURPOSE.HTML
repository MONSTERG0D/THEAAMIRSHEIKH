        <h2>PURPOSE</h2>
        <p>Welcome
            <br>
            This site is designed as a space where I can share a glimpse of my professional & personal journey.
            <br>
            Here, you’ll find a showcase of my skills and expertise,
            <br>
             A collection of the projects I’m currently working on or have completed, <br>
           A little narrative about who I am.<br>
            <br>
            

This website isn't just a resume—it's a living, breathing record of what I'm doing and where I’m headed. You’ll get to see the technologies I’m passionate about, the challenges I’m tackling, and the goals I’ve set for myself.<br> 
I’ll also share a glimpse about my background—where I’m from, what inspires me, and what keeps me motivated.

In addition to that, you’ll find updates on what’s happening in my life right now and what my future plans look like—both in terms of my career and personal growth. My hope is that this portfolio not only gives you a sense of what I do, but also who I am and what I aspire to achieve.<br>
 Thanks for taking the time to explore, and I hope you enjoy the journey through my work and my story!</p>
