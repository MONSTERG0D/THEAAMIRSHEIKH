        </h2>
        <p>Everyone faces struggles in their journey toward achieving their goals. Here are some of the common struggles I have encountered and how I am working to overcome them:
        <br><br>
        #1. Time Management: I am struggling with this.
        <br>
        #2. Learning Curve: I often find myself overwhelmed by the amount of new information.<br>

        #3. Self-Doubt: There are times when I question my abilities and whether I can achieve my goals.<br>
        #4. Resource Limitations: I sometimes lack access to the tools and resources I need to succeed.<br>
        #5. Balancing Priorities: Juggling multiple responsibilities can be challenging.<br>
        <br>
        To overcome these struggles, I am implementing strategies such as setting clear goals, seeking mentorship, and continuously learning and adapting.
